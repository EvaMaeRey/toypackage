# toypackage

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of toypackage is to ...

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub.


# Part 2. Packaging and documentation  ðŸš§ âœ… 



## minimal requirements for github package.  Have you:

### Created files for package archetecture with `devtools::create("./ggbarlabs")` âœ… 

### Moved functions R folder? âœ…  

```{r}
knitr::knit_code$get() |> names()
```


```{r, eval = F}
readme2pkg::chunk_to_r()
```



### Added roxygen skeleton? âœ… 

 for auto documentation and making sure proposed functions are *exported*

### Managed dependencies ? âœ… 

package dependencies managed, i.e. `depend::function()` in proposed functions and declared in the DESCRIPTION

### Chosen a license? âœ… 


```{r, eval = F}
usethis::use_package("ggplot2")
usethis::use_mit_license()
```

### Run `devtools::check()` and addressed errors? âœ… 


## Listen ðŸš§ 

### Consulted with technical experts ðŸš§ 
### Consulted with potential users ðŸš§ 

Getting started with that!

## Polish.  Have you.

### Settled on examples and put them in the roxygen skeleton? ðŸš§ 

### Written formal tests of functions? ðŸš§ 


### Sent tests in this readme to package via readme2pkg ðŸš§ 

That would look like this...

```
chunk_to_tests_testthat("test_geom_barlab_count")
```


### Have you worked added a description and author information in the DESCRIPTION file? ðŸš§ 

### Addressed *all* notes, warnings and errors. ðŸš§ 

## Promote

### Package website built? ðŸš§ 

### Package website deployed? ðŸš§ 

## Harden

### Submit to CRAN?  ðŸš§ 


# Reports, Environment

## Description file extract

```{r}

```

## Environment

Here I just want to print the packages and the versions

```{r}
all <- sessionInfo() |> print() |> capture.output()
all[11:17]


```

## `devtools::check()` report

```{r, error = T}
# rm(list = c("geom_barlab_count", "geom_barlab_count_percent"))
devtools::check(pkg = ".")
```
