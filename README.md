<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of toypackage is to â€¦

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

Youâ€™ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also
use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An
example workflow can be found here:
<https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](README_files/figure-gfm/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

In that case, donâ€™t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub.

# Part 2. Packaging and documentation ðŸš§ âœ…

## minimal requirements for github package. Have you:

### Created files for package archetecture with `devtools::create("./ggbarlabs")` âœ…

### Moved functions R folder? âœ…

``` r
knitr::knit_code$get() |> names()
#> [1] "unnamed-chunk-1" "cars"            "pressure"        "unnamed-chunk-2"
#> [5] "unnamed-chunk-3" "unnamed-chunk-4" "unnamed-chunk-5" "unnamed-chunk-6"
#> [9] "unnamed-chunk-7"
```

``` r
readme2pkg::chunk_to_r()
```

### Added roxygen skeleton? âœ…

for auto documentation and making sure proposed functions are *exported*

### Managed dependencies ? âœ…

package dependencies managed, i.e.Â `depend::function()` in proposed
functions and declared in the DESCRIPTION

### Chosen a license? âœ…

``` r
usethis::use_package("ggplot2")
usethis::use_mit_license()
```

### Run `devtools::check()` and addressed errors? âœ…

## Listen ðŸš§

### Consulted with technical experts ðŸš§

### Consulted with potential users ðŸš§

Getting started with that\!

## Polish. Have you.

### Settled on examples and put them in the roxygen skeleton? ðŸš§

### Written formal tests of functions? ðŸš§

### Sent tests in this readme to package via readme2pkg ðŸš§

That would look like thisâ€¦

    chunk_to_tests_testthat("test_geom_barlab_count")

### Have you worked added a description and author information in the DESCRIPTION file? ðŸš§

### Addressed *all* notes, warnings and errors. ðŸš§

## Promote

### Package website built? ðŸš§

### Package website deployed? ðŸš§

## Harden

### Submit to CRAN? ðŸš§

# Reports, Environment

## Description file extract

## Environment

Here I just want to print the packages and the versions

``` r
all <- sessionInfo() |> print() |> capture.output()
all[11:17]
#> [1] ""                                                                         
#> [2] "attached base packages:"                                                  
#> [3] "[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     "
#> [4] ""                                                                         
#> [5] "loaded via a namespace (and not attached):"                               
#> [6] " [1] compiler_4.2.2  fastmap_1.1.1   cli_3.6.1       tools_4.2.2    "     
#> [7] " [5] htmltools_0.5.4 rstudioapi_0.14 yaml_2.3.7      rmarkdown_2.20 "
```

## `devtools::check()` report

``` r
# rm(list = c("geom_barlab_count", "geom_barlab_count_percent"))
devtools::check(pkg = ".")
#> Error in `package_file()`:
#> ! Could not find package root.
#> â„¹ Is '.' inside a package?
```
